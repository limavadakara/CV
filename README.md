## Skills

#### Problem Solving

I enjoy being set a challenge and finding creative and efficient ways of solving it. A substantial part of my IT experience was in Operations where I handled requests to first understand a Business problem and then provide suitable solutions. 

I was also involved in overnight support and escalation for IT systems in the early years of my career. As example of a Retail problem I worked through at John Lewis to understand and provide a solution for was the fact that customer orders were having to be manually cancelled due to the Business not being able to source the product. My approach was to provide a short term, quick solution that partially solved the issue along with a long-term, more expensive full solution. The short term solution got implemented while the long-term proposal never got funding.

I now provide help to teams trying to understand the complex systems landscape to break down big problems to understand changes required end-to-end.

#### Communication 

A large part of my work has involved working with various teams and stakeholders, some of whom may have conflicting interests. I easily adapt my ways to the needs of the recipient by balancing technical and non-technical content appropriately. 

My experience on Operations Teams has helped me pick up skills to convey good and bad news to stakeholders while workingwith the team to get through difficult situations. 

I have conducted many workshops in my role as Solution Designer with diverse audiences including Business stakeholders, Architects, Technical Team leads and Analysts and have gained a lot of valuable knowledge on what works and what doesn't. 

I have also learnt that different techniques may be required to get the best out of people and people find it easier to agree if they are empowered and bought into the overall goal.

#### Fast Learner and Team Player

Being the Solution Designer on the 'Omni Channel Customer Ordering' program responsible to make sure that the end-to-end functionality (from the time customer starts checking out on the John Lewis website up to the point the customer receives the item and subsequent reverse logistics for returns) meant I had to learn about many systems quickly along with some of the technologies they used, query some of their databases, look at the code and system logs (some of them quite old) to answer key questions and make quick technical and convincing decisions for the relevant teams to implement.

I was the glue between the various technical teams involving over 20+ systems on disparate technologies and different ways of working. I worked with them especially when conflicting priorities arose to arrive at practical, workable solutions.

#### Analysis

My years as a Technical Business Analyst provided me with the skills to turn a one-liner requirement or problem into tangible units of work. I enjoy exploring new things and asking questions to cement my understanding about them. 
These skills have been particularly useful in my short stint at switching from the Retail sector into Banking and back again and also in my recent role as a Solution Designer.
 
I use data from systems a lot in my analysis as data states and values can speak volumes about the behaviour of a system/system landscape; especially if it is very complex. This skill to use and interpret data has been very effective in most of my IT roles.

#### Solution Design

Solution Design is about end-to-end; although aruguably technical teams are shrinking, complexity of the systems landscape for companies is still a challenge. In my role as Solution Designer, I worked with Architects and Analysts to break down the complexity involved in processes as well as system responsibilities to provide clear direction for technical teams. This sometimes involved reviewing/challenging and changing Architectural recommendations based on actual system data and implementation details constraints and complexities.

Working for the 'Omni Channel Customer Ordering' I focussed on the interaction between systems and its timing in a landscape involving 20+ systems; notably synchronous and asynchronous ways of interactions, systems logging, realtime and batch processing and timings.

This role also involved making clear and quick technical decisions below the high level architectural recommendations when the technical teams had questions/challenges/blocks/constraints. 
Some of the decisions amoung others were about -
- Type of services to be built/used(Microservices Vs enterprise style SOA services)
- Customising a package Vs using it vanilla and changing the process or shifting the responsibility for a functionality to another system 
- Data that specific systems should hold so that the end-to-end works, 
- Which system masters what data and how can it be retrieved when required, 
- The bare minimum (MVP) Vs the long term/proper solution to go-live, 
- How technical debt will be owned and addressed 
- How to ensure supportability of the solution for OPS amoung others.

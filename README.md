## Skills

#### Problem Solving

With my background in working in IT Operations and IT programmes, I can break down complex Business problems into smaller ones and provide the most effective solution. For complex problems, given the constraints I take a short term/long term solution approach.

#### Communication 

A large part of my work has involved working with various teams and stakeholders, some of whom may have conflicting interests. I easily adapt my messages to the needs of the recipients by balancing technical and non-technical content appropriately. 

I have conducted many workshops in my role as Solution Designer with diverse audiences including Business stakeholders, Architects, Technical Team leads and Analysts bringing them together with a common purpose.

#### Fast Learner and Team Player

Being the Solution Designer on the 'Omni Channel Customer Ordering' program responsible to make sure that the end-to-end functionality (from the time customer starts checking out on the John Lewis website up to the point the customer receives the item and subsequent reverse logistics for returns) meant I had to learn about many systems quickly along with some of the technologies they used, query some of their databases, look at the code and system logs (some of them quite old) to answer key questions and make quick technical and convincing decisions for the relevant teams to implement.

I was the glue between the various technical teams involving over 20+ systems on disparate technologies and different ways of working. I worked with them especially when conflicting priorities arose to arrive at practical, workable solutions.

#### Analysis

My years as a Technical Business Analyst has provided me with the skills to turn a one-liner requirement or problem into tangible units of work. I enjoy exploring new things and asking questions to cement my understanding about them. 
 
I use data from systems a lot in my analysis as data states and values can speak volumes about the behaviour of a system/system landscape; especially if it is very complex. This skill to use and interpret data has been very effective in most of my IT roles.

#### Solution Design

While working on the 'Omni Channel Customer Ordering' at John Lewis, I focussed on the interaction between systems in a landscape involving 20+ systems; notably synchronous and asynchronous modes, systems logging, realtime and batch processing.

This role also involved making clear and quick technical decisions below the high level architectural recommendations when the technical teams had questions/challenges/blocks/constraints. 
Some of the decisions amoung others were about -
- Type of services to be built/used(Microservices Vs enterprise style SOA services hosted on the Enterprise Service Bus)
- Customising a package Vs using it vanilla and changing the process or shifting the responsibility for a functionality to another system 
- Data that specific systems should hold so that the end-to-end works, 
- Which system masters what data and how can it be retrieved when required, 
- The bare minimum (MVP) Vs the long term/proper solution to go-live, 
- How technical debt will be owned and addressed 
- How to ensure supportability of the solution for OPS amoung others.
